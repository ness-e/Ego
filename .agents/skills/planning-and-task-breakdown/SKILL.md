# Planning and Task Breakdown

## Overview

Decompose work into small, verifiable tasks with explicit acceptance criteria. Good task breakdown is the difference between an agent that completes work reliably and one that produces a tangled mess. Every task should be small enough to implement, test, and verify in a single focused session.

## When to Use

- You have a spec and need to break it into implementable units
- A task feels too large or vague to start
- Work needs to be parallelized across multiple agents or sessions
- You need to communicate scope to a human
- The implementation order isn't obvious

**When NOT to use:** Single-file changes with obvious scope, or when the spec already contains well-defined tasks.

## The Planning Process

### Step 1: Enter Plan Mode

Before writing any code, operate in read-only mode:

- Read the spec and relevant codebase sections
- Identify existing patterns and conventions
- Map dependencies between components
- Note risks and unknowns

**Do NOT write code during planning.** The output is a plan document saved to `tasks/plan.md` and a task list recorded in the task list target (see Output Files; default `tasks/todo.md`), not implementation.

> **Ego note — campaign-executor alignment:** In Ego, planning maps to the `campaign-executor` DISCOVERY phase. Use `codegraph_codegraph_explore` for blast-radius mapping and web research if ambiguous, then create `docs/dev/plans/<fecha>-<nombre>.md` (plan file) and `tasks/<ID>.md` at `.agents/skills/campaign-executor/tasks/<ID>.md` (task files with atomic steps). **Do NOT write code during planning** — this is a read-only discovery step; implementation starts in ACT via `iter-loop-tools.md`. See `.agents/task-system/prompts/plan.md` and `skills/campaign-executor/SKILL.md`.

### Step 2: Identify the Dependency Graph

Map what depends on what:

```
Database schema
    │
    ├── API models/types
    │       │
    │       ├── API endpoints
    │       │       │
    │       │       └── Frontend API client
    │       │               │
    │       │               └── UI components
    │       │
    │       └── Validation logic
    │
    └── Seed data / migrations
```

Implementation order follows the dependency graph bottom-up: build foundations first.

### Step 3: Slice Vertically

Instead of building all the database, then all the API, then all the UI — build one complete feature path at a time:

**Bad (horizontal slicing):**
```
Task 1: Build entire database schema
Task 2: Build all API endpoints
Task 3: Build all UI components
Task 4: Connect everything
```

**Good (vertical slicing):**
```
Task 1: User can create an account (schema + API + UI for registration)
Task 2: User can log in (auth schema + API + UI for login)
Task 3: User can create a task (task schema + API + UI for creation)
Task 4: User can view task list (query + API + UI for list view)
```

Each vertical slice delivers working, testable functionality.

### Step 4: Write Tasks

Each task follows this structure, whether it lands in the markdown task list or as an item in an external tracker (see Output Files):

```markdown
## Task [N]: [Short descriptive title]

**Description:** One paragraph explaining what this task accomplishes.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific, testable condition]
- [ ] [Specific, testable condition]

**Verification:**
- [ ] Tests pass: [the repository's focused-test command]
- [ ] Build succeeds: [the repository's build command]
- [ ] Manual check: [description of what to verify]

**Dependencies:** [Task numbers this depends on, or "None"]

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/path/to/file.ts`
- `tests/path/to/test.ts`

**Estimated scope:** [Small: 1-2 files | Medium: 3-5 files | Large: 5+ files]
```

> **Ego verification examples:** Prefer Ego cargo tools — `cargo nextest run --profile audit --workspace --build-jobs 2`, `cargo check -p Ego`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check` — over generic `npm` examples when the task touches Rust. For Python bindings: `target/audit-venv/Scripts/python -m pytest Ego-python/tests/test_sdk.py`. See `systematic-debugging` for root-cause investigation if verification fails.

### Step 5: Order and Checkpoint

Arrange tasks so that:

1. Dependencies are satisfied (build foundation first)
2. Each task leaves the system in a working state
3. Verification checkpoints occur after every 2-3 tasks
4. High-risk tasks are early (fail fast)

Add explicit checkpoints to the task list target:

```markdown
## Checkpoint: After Tasks 1-3
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Application builds without errors
- [ ] Core user flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Review with human before proceeding
```

## Task Sizing Guidelines

| Size | Files | Scope | Example |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| **XS** | 1 | Single function or config change | Add a validation rule |
| **S** | 1-2 | One component or endpoint | Add a new API endpoint |
| **M** | 3-5 | One feature slice | User registration flow |
| **L** | 5-8 | Multi-component feature | Search with filtering and pagination |
| **XL** | 8+ | **Too large — break it down further** | — |

If a task is L or larger, it should be broken into smaller tasks. An agent performs best on S and M tasks.

**When to break a task down further:**
- It would take more than one focused session (roughly 2+ hours of agent work)
- You cannot describe the acceptance criteria in 3 or fewer bullet points
- It touches two or more independent subsystems (e.g., auth and billing)
- You find yourself writing "and" in the task title (a sign it is two tasks)

## Output Files

- **Plan document:** Save the implementation plan to `tasks/plan.md`. This is always a markdown file — design decisions, risks, and open questions don't map cleanly onto individual tracker issues.
- **Task list:** Record each task in the **task list target** (defined below).

Create the `tasks/` directory if it does not exist.

**Never overwrite an incomplete plan.** Before writing `tasks/plan.md` or `tasks/todo.md`, check whether they already exist and still contain unchecked tasks:

- Same work being replanned (the user asked to revise or extend this plan) → update the existing files in place.
- Different work → **stop and ask.** The unchecked tasks may be mid-build in another session. Do not delete, overwrite, or rename the existing files on your own; present the conflict and let the user decide (finish the old plan first, explicitly discard it, or tell you where the new plan should go).

The same rule applies to an external task list target: never bulk-close or delete another plan's open tracker items to make room for new ones.

> **Ego path resolution:** In Ego, the canonical plan location is `docs/dev/plans/<fecha>-<nombre>.md` (not `tasks/plan.md`) and task files live at `.agents/skills/campaign-executor/tasks/<ID>.md` (resolved via `tasks/<ID>.md` → `.agents/skills/campaign-executor/tasks/<ID>.md` per `AGENTS.md` Path Resolution). The generic `tasks/plan.md` / `tasks/todo.md` convention in upstream maps to those Ego paths. When using the Ego task system, also check `.agents/task-system/prompts/plan.md` and honor `campaign-executor` state machine (PLAN/ACT/VERIFY) — never overwrite a plan file with unchecked tasks without asking.

### Task List Target

The task list target is where tasks and checkpoints are recorded. It is defined once, here; every other reference in this skill defers to it.

- **Default: a checklist-style markdown file at `tasks/todo.md`.** This is the convention the `/build` command and other downstream tooling expect. Use it unless the project says otherwise.
- **External tracker:** if the project's agent rules (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) or the user designate an issue tracker (e.g. GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear, `bd`/beads), create one tracker item per task instead of writing `tasks/todo.md`. Map the Step 4 structure onto the tracker's fields: acceptance criteria and verification steps in the item body, dependencies via the tracker's linking mechanism (`bd dep add`, "blocked by", etc.). Record Step 5 checkpoints as tracker items too, or as a checklist in the plan document if the tracker has no natural equivalent.

When using an external tracker, note it in `tasks/plan.md` (e.g. "Tasks tracked in Linear project FOO") so downstream steps and future sessions know where to look, and keep the plan document's Task List section as an ordered index of tracker item IDs or links rather than a duplicate checklist.

> **Ego external tracker:** Ego's own tracker is the `campaign` MCP (`campaign_get_next_task`, `campaign_update_task_state`, `campaign_verify_cmd`) with plan files in `docs/dev/plans/`. When the plan file is the task list target, treat it as the external tracker — do not duplicate tasks in both `tasks/todo.md` and `docs/dev/plans/`.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Risk] | [High/Med/Low] | [Strategy] |

## Open Questions
- [Question needing human input]
```

When tasks live in an external tracker, keep the Task List section above as an ordered index of tracker item IDs or links instead of a duplicate checklist.

## Parallelization Opportunities

When multiple agents or sessions are available:

- **Safe to parallelize:** Independent feature slices, tests for already-implemented features, documentation
- **Must be sequential:** Database migrations, shared state changes, dependency chains
- **Needs coordination:** Features that share an API contract (define the contract first, then parallelize)

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll figure it out as I go" | That's how you end up with a tangled mess and rework. 10 minutes of planning saves hours. |
| "The tasks are obvious" | Write them down anyway. Explicit tasks surface hidden dependencies and forgotten edge cases. |
| "Planning is overhead" | Planning is the task. Implementation without a plan is just typing. |
| "I can hold it all in my head" | Context windows are finite. Written plans survive session boundaries and compaction. |
| "The old `tasks/plan.md` is stale, I'll just replace it" | Unchecked tasks may be mid-build in another session. Overwriting them destroys work state that exists nowhere else. Stop and ask. |

## Red Flags

- Starting implementation without a written task list
- Overwriting a `tasks/plan.md` or `tasks/todo.md` that still has unchecked tasks for different work, without asking
- Writing `tasks/todo.md` when the project has designated an external tracker (or scattering tasks across both)
- Tasks that say "implement the feature" without acceptance criteria
- No verification steps in the plan
- All tasks are XL-sized
- No checkpoints between tasks
- Dependency order isn't considered

## Verification

Before starting implementation, confirm:

- [ ] Every task has acceptance criteria
- [ ] Every task has a verification step
- [ ] Task dependencies are identified and ordered correctly
- [ ] Tasks are recorded in the task list target (default `tasks/todo.md`)
- [ ] No pre-existing incomplete plan was overwritten without explicit user confirmation
- [ ] No task touches more than ~5 files
- [ ] Checkpoints exist between major phases
- [ ] The human has reviewed and approved the plan

## Ego Integration

This skill is tightly coupled to `campaign-executor` in Ego:

- **Planning is read-only discovery** — aligns with `campaign-executor` MODO DISCOVERY: use `codegraph_codegraph_explore` for blast radius, `.agents/task-system/prompts/plan.md` for triage gate, and create task files with atomic steps. Never write code during planning.
- **Task files over todo.md** — for Ego work, prefer `docs/dev/plans/` + `tasks/<ID>.md` (→ `.agents/skills/campaign-executor/tasks/<ID>.md`) over generic `tasks/todo.md`. The verification contract in each task file must use a verifiable command (`cargo nextest run ...`, `cargo clippy ...`, etc.).
- **Systematic debugging on verification failure** — if verification fails, switch to `systematic-debugging` (not `debugging-and-error-recovery`, which is deprecated) for root-cause investigation before proposing fixes.
- **Definition of Done** — acceptance criteria sit on top of `.agents/references/definition-of-done.md` (not `../../references/definition-of-done.md`). See also `.agents/task-system/prompts/iter-loop-tools.md` for the PLAN→ACT→VERIFY state machine.

## See Also

Acceptance criteria are per-task and answer "did we build the right thing?". They sit on top of the project-wide Definition of Done, the standing bar every task clears before it counts as done. See `.agents/references/definition-of-done.md` (Ego) / `../../references/definition-of-done.md` (upstream generic). Also see `campaign-executor`, `systematic-debugging`, and `.agents/task-system/prompts/plan.md` for Ego task-system integration.
