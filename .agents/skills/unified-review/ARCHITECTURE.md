# Architecture — Unified Review & Audit Skill

---

## 1. Problem statement

The three legacy skills (`Ego-full-review`, `Ego-certify`,
`Ego-audit`) all run **monolithically** — the primary agent executes
every check itself: `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo nextest`,
`pytest`, `npm run build`, security review, performance review, code
review, and report generation. This works for small projects but fails
on Ego (~790 files, 17+ Rust crates, 3 SDK bindings, Next.js web):

- A single `cargo check --workspace` produces ~30 KB of output and takes
  2 minutes. Multiplied by every check, the agent's context window fills
  up before the report can be written.
- Skills loaded for review (`code-review-and-quality`,
  `doubt-driven-development`, `code-simplification`, `security-and-hardening`,
  `deprecation-and-migration`, `systematic-debugging`) each consume 5-15%
  of context just to load.
- The agent truncates output, drops findings, or times out before reaching
  the report phase.

## 2. Solution: fan-out / fan-in with sub-agents

The unified skill uses OpenCode's `task` tool to delegate each phase to a
**sub-agent**. Each sub-agent:

1. Receives a self-contained prompt with the `DetectionResult` JSON and
   the phase config.
2. Runs its commands (cargo, npm, pytest, etc.) in its own context window.
3. Loads any cross-cutting skills it needs (in its own context, not the
   orchestrator's).
4. Returns a structured JSON report — **only the JSON, no prose, no logs**.
5. Exits. Its context is freed.

The orchestrator's context stays under 10% because it only ever sees the
JSON reports (typically 1-5 KB each), never the raw command output.

## 3. Data contracts

### 3.1 DetectionResult (orchestrator → every sub-agent)

Built by Phase 0, passed to every sub-agent in its prompt. See
`SKILL.md → DetectionResult JSON contract` for the full schema.

### 3.2 PhaseReport (sub-agent → orchestrator)

Each sub-agent MUST return a single JSON object and nothing else.

```json
{
  "phase": "L1",
  "phase_name": "Core Language Check",
  "status": "pass|fail|warn|skip|timeout|error",
  "score": 8,                          // 0-score_max, null if phase has no score
  "score_max": 10,
  "duration_ms": 23456,
  "subagent_type_used": "ego-worker",// actual type used (may differ if fallback)
  "commands_run": [
    {
      "cmd": "cargo check --workspace --tests -j 2",
      "exit": 0,
      "duration_ms": 12345,
      "summary": "ok. 17 crates checked."  // ≤ 200 chars
    },
    {
      "cmd": "pnpm typecheck",
      "exit": 1,
      "duration_ms": 8901,
      "summary": "error: found 2 warnings, -D warnings turned them into errors"
    }
  ],
  "quality_gates": [
    {"condition": "All compile/lint commands exit 0", "passed": false},
    {"condition": "All unit tests pass", "passed": true}
  ],
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "H01-CODE-001",
      "severity": "high",
      "category": "CODE",

    }
  ],
  "vetoes": [                           // only L9 fills this; cognitive phase
    {

  },
  "raw_log_path": "docs/agent-ops/reports/reviews/logs/L1-2026-07-26-1430.log"  // only if keep_raw_logs
}
```

### 3.3 ConsolidatedReport (orchestrator builds internally)

The orchestrator holds this in-memory and writes it to disk as the final
markdown report. Schema:

```json
{
  "profile": "Ego",
  "mode": "certify",
  "started_at": "2026-07-26T14:30:00-04:00",
  "ended_at": "2026-07-26T14:38:42-04:00",
  "duration_ms": 522000,
  "phases": [/* PhaseReport objects */],
  "overall_score": 7.2,
  "overall_rating": "B",
  "quality_gate_passed": false,
  "findings_count": {"critical": 1, "high": 4, "medium": 10, "low": 3, "info": 0},
  "cross_cutting_findings": [...],
  "top_critical_findings": [...]
}
```

## 4. Sub-agent prompt template

The orchestrator builds each sub-agent's prompt by interpolating
DetectionResult, the phase config, and the diff context into this template:

```
You are running Phase {phase_id} ({phase_name}) of the unified-review skill.

## Context

Mode: {mode}
Profile: {profile_name}
Project: {project_type}
Languages: {languages}
Ponytail mode: {ponytail_mode}

## DetectionResult

{detection_result_json}

## Phase configuration

{phase_config_yaml}

## Diff context (changed files)

{changed_files_list}

## Your task

1. Run every command listed in `commands` for the detected language(s).
   For each, capture: command, exit code, duration, summary (≤ 200 chars).

2. Evaluate each `quality_gates` condition. Mark passed/failed.

3. Scan the changed files for findings. Each finding:
   - Gets a unique ID: H<phase_num><CATEGORY>-<NNN>
   - Has severity: critical|high|medium|low|info
   - Has category: one of LOGIC|PATTERN|ARCH|DIRECTION|CLARITY|CODE|DESIGN|ERROR|MISSING|FEATURE|ALGO|ANY
   - Has file + line + description + recommendation

4. {if scoring.enabled} Compute per-system scores per the schema above. {endif}

5. {if phase.cognitive} Load each skill in `skills_to_load` (one at a time,
   in order). Apply its framework. Record findings. If a skill issues a
   VETO, record it (do not abort). {endif}

6. {if ponytail_mode == "lite"} Skip findings where category=DIRECTION and
   subcategory=Over-engineering. {endif}
   {if ponytail_mode == "ultra"} Escalate DIRECTION/Over-engineering findings
   by one severity level (info→low→medium→high→critical, but don't escalate
   beyond critical). {endif}

7. Compute your phase score (0-score_max). Suggested formula:
   - Start at score_max
   - Subtract 2 per failed quality gate
   - Subtract 1 per critical finding, 0.5 per high, 0.2 per medium
   - Floor at 0

8. {if orchestration.keep_raw_logs} Write your full raw output (commands +
   findings + skill outputs) to {raw_log_path}. Do NOT include it in the
   JSON below. {endif}

## Return

Return ONLY a single JSON object matching the PhaseReport schema. No prose,
no markdown fences, no commentary. The orchestrator will parse it.

If you cannot produce JSON for any reason, return:
  {"phase": "{phase_id}", "status": "error", "error": "<one-line reason>"}
```

## 5. Failure handling

### 5.1 Critical phase failure (L1)

L1 is the only critical phase. If L1 fails:

1. Orchestrator stops launching further waves.
2. Already-running wave-1 sub-agents (none in this case, L1 runs alone)
   are allowed to complete.
3. Orchestrator writes a **failure report** with:
   - The L1 PhaseReport (with failed commands and findings).
   - Skipped phases listed with `status: "skipped"`.
   - Overall Quality Gate: FAIL.
4. Exit.

### 5.2 Mechanical phase failure (L2-L5)

If L2-L5 fail:
1. Mark the phase `status: "fail"`.
2. Continue with other parallel phases.
3. If `orchestration.retry_mechanical: true`, the orchestrator relaunches
   the failed sub-agent ONCE with the same prompt.
4. After retry, status stays `fail` if it failed again.
5. The overall Quality Gate is marked FAIL iff any mechanical phase has
   status `fail` (not `warn`).

### 5.3 Cognitive phase failure / veto (L6, L9)

Cognitive phases produce subjective findings. They can't "fail" in the
mechanical sense, but they can issue **vetoes**:

- A veto is a structured objection from a loaded skill.
- Vetoes are recorded in the PhaseReport under `vetoes: [...]`.
- Vetoes do NOT abort the pipeline (per legacy `Ego-certify` behavior).
- BUT if `veto_policy.escalate_if_vetoes_ge: N`, the orchestrator marks
  the overall Quality Gate as FAIL when a single phase has N or more vetoes.
  Default N = 3.

### 5.4 Sub-agent timeout

If a sub-agent doesn't return within `phase.timeout_ms`:

1. Orchestrator marks `status: "timeout"`.
2. Records `duration_ms: <timeout_ms>`.
3. No findings recorded for this phase.
4. Continues with other phases.
5. Includes a warning in the report: "Phase X timed out after Y minutes."

### 5.5 Sub-agent crash / malformed JSON

If a sub-agent returns non-JSON or crashes:

1. Orchestrator marks `status: "error"`.
2. Stores the raw output (truncated to 500 chars) in
   `phase_report.error_raw`.
3. Continues with other phases.
4. Includes a warning in the report.

### 5.6 Sub-agent type not found

If the profile references a `subagent_type` that isn't built-in and isn't
defined in `.agents/agents/` or `opencode.json`:

1. Orchestrator falls back to `general`.
2. Records `subagent_type_used: "general"` (different from configured).
3. Emits a warning at the top of the report.
4. Continues.

## 6. Context budget verification

### 6.1 Orchestrator budget

The orchestrator should stay under 10% of the model's context window.
Approximate budget per mode:

| Mode | Phases | PhaseReports (~3KB each) | Orchestrator overhead | Total |
|------|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| quick | L0, L1 | 1 × 3KB | 5KB | ~8KB |
| certify | L0-L6 | 6 × 3KB | 10KB | ~28KB |
| review | L0, L1, L6, L9 | 4 × 3KB | 8KB | ~20KB |
| full | L0-L9 | 10 × 3KB + scoring (5KB) | 15KB | ~50KB |

Even on a 100K-context model, `full` mode consumes ~50KB / 100K = 0.5%.
The orchestrator has plenty of headroom for prompt parsing, profile
loading, and report writing.

### 6.2 Sub-agent budget

Each sub-agent runs in its own context. Worst case (L1 on Ego):

- Prompt: ~5KB (DetectionResult + phase config + diff context)
- Skill load (e.g. `code-review-and-quality`): ~10KB
- Command output (cargo check + clippy + nextest): ~30KB
- Findings JSON: ~2KB
- Total: ~47KB

On a 100K-context model, that's 47%. Sub-agent has plenty of headroom to
load multiple skills and process output.

### 6.3 What breaks the budget

Things that would blow the orchestrator's context:

- ❌ Streaming sub-agent logs into the orchestrator (logs are 30KB each × 10 phases = 300KB).
- ❌ Loading cross-cutting skills in the orchestrator (each is 5-15KB × 6 skills = 60KB).
- ❌ Re-reading source files in the orchestrator (a single 1000-line file is ~10KB).
- ❌ Including raw command output in the final report (the report should be
  structured markdown, not a log dump).

The skill is designed to avoid all of these. Raw logs go to
`docs/agent-ops/reports/reviews/logs/` (if `keep_raw_logs: true`) and are linked from the
report, not embedded.

## 7. Subagent type definitions (reference)

Custom Ego subagent types referenced by the Ego profile. To use
them, create markdown files in `.agents/agents/` — see OpenCode's agents
docs for the full format.

1. Add an entry to `phases:` in `default.yml` (or your project profile).
2. Use the next available ID (L12, L13, ...). L0-L11 are reserved.
3. Add the phase ID to the relevant `modes:` entries.
4. If the phase should be parallel, set `parallel: true` and pick a
   `subagent_type`.
5. Document it in `SKILL.md → Phase Catalog`.

### 8.2 Add a new profile

1. Create `profiles/<myproject>.yml`.
2. Set `profile.inherits: default` (or `Ego`).
3. Override only what differs.
4. Use with `/review <mode> --profile myproject`.

### 8.3 Add a new scoring system

1. Add an entry under `scoring.weights` (must keep sum at 100).
2. Update each phase's `scoring_breakdown` to include the new system.
3. Update the report template in `SKILL.md → Report Format` to render it.

### 8.4 Add a new integration

1. Add an entry under `integrations:` in the profile.
2. Implement the detection logic in Phase 0 (check for available tools).
3. Implement the integration behavior in the relevant phase or in L10/L11.
4. Document it in `SKILL.md`.

## 9. Testing the skill

### 9.1 Manual smoke test

```
/review quick
```

Should:
- Run Phase 0 (detect).
- Launch one sub-agent for L1.
- Return a single-page report at `docs/agent-ops/reports/reviews/review-quick-<timestamp>.md`.
- Take < 2 minutes.

### 9.2 Verify context budget

After running `/review full --profile Ego`:

1. Check the orchestrator's session token count. Should be < 50K tokens
   (well under the model's context window).
2. Check that each sub-agent session exists as a child session
   (`session_child_first` keybind).
3. Verify the report contains links to raw logs (if `keep_raw_logs: true`),
   not inline logs.

### 9.3 Verify failure handling

1. Introduce a compile error in a Rust file.
2. Run `/review certify --profile Ego`.
3. Verify: L1 fails, pipeline aborts, L2-L6 are skipped, report shows
   Quality Gate: FAIL, the L1 failure is in the report.

### 9.4 Verify Ponytail integration

1. Set Ponytail mode to `lite` (`/ponytail lite` or env var).
2. Run `/review review --profile Ego`.
3. Verify: L6 is skipped, no `DIRECTION/Over-engineering` findings in report.

4. Set Ponytail mode to `ultra`.
5. Run the same command.
6. Verify: any `DIRECTION/Over-engineering` findings are escalated one
   severity level.

## 10. Open questions / future work

- **Streaming consolidation**: currently the orchestrator waits for all
  sub-agents before consolidating. Could stream partial results if a phase
  exceeds timeout, but this complicates the contract.
- **Cross-project profile inheritance**: currently `inherits` is a single
  string. Could be an array for diamond inheritance, but the merge semantics
  get complex.
- **Per-phase model selection**: profiles can already override
  `subagent_type`, but not the underlying model. Could add a `model:` field
  per phase (e.g. use Haiku for L5 docs, Sonnet for L9 review, Opus for L6
  architecture).
- **Persistent findings database**: store findings across runs to detect
  regressions and track fix velocity. Would need a `findings.jsonl` per
  project.
- **Plan file diffing**: when running `/review certify` repeatedly, diff
  the new plan file against the previous one to highlight what changed.
